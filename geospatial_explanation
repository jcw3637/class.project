I will use my geospatial data to create a map showing the locations of each tree/stump sampled. 
I will also use the polygon functions to add borders around the different tracks and sites that are included in the study.
It may also be useful to plot so of the fires that occured. 
I will need to play around with this and details as we dig into the project.
